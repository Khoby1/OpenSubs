His conflict, his sacrifice, and even his kind \Nsmile will fade gently into the mists of time.\NNo, it is better that way. It must be forgotten,\N because it was, most definitely, not the story of a hero.\NEventually, all subjectivity on the matter will be lost, and it\N will all be viewed from a historical perspective, as a classic.\N\NOne day, we ourselves will be the classics of the future.
